# Inventory

This directory contains Ansible inventory files for OVH server deployment.

- `hosts.yml`: Main inventory file (add your server details here)
- `hosts.example.yml`: Example template to copy from (this is done via Just automatically)

Copy `hosts.example.yml` to `hosts.yml` and update with your server's IP address and configuration variables.
